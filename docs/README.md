# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation hub. This folder centralizes our project management processes, templates, checklists, and role definitions to help teams onboard quickly and run projects consistently.

## Brief overview of our project management processes

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, iterative delivery model organized around the following stages:

- Initiation — validate the problem and define measurable outcomes. Create a Project One-pager with stakeholders, success metrics, and a high-level timeline.
- Planning — convert an approved initiative into an actionable backlog and release plan. Define the Definition of Done, estimate work, and capture dependencies and risks.
- Execution &amp; Tracking — implement work in small increments, use the project board to track progress, follow PR and CI guidelines, and run regular syncs and demos.
- Release &amp; Deployment — ensure pre-release checks, automated deployments where possible, smoke tests, and a rollback plan. Announce releases and update stakeholders.
- Retrospective &amp; Continuous Improvement — capture learnings after milestones or incidents, create action items with owners and due dates, and track improvements.

Our process emphasizes clear ownership, measurable outcomes, psychological safety for learning, and continuous improvement.
